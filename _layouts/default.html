          <h3 class="modal-subtitle">Before you access our performance data, we ask for your name and email. Here's why:</h3>
          <div class="modal-content">
              <p>It's about transparency and compliance. Investment firms like ours are bound by regulatory standards, which means we need to know who is reviewing our information. This simple step helps us ensure we are sharing sensitive data with the right people. Regulations such as SEC guidelines and data protection laws require us to keep track of who is viewing our performance informationâ€”it's all about maintaining transparency and protecting both your interests and ours.</p>
              
              <p>It's also about building a connection. By sharing your name and email, you allow us to establish a direct line of communication. Whether you have questions or want to explore more about what we do, we can respond personally and provide the tailored information that matters most to you.</p>
              
              <p>We're committed to keeping your information secure and only using it to enhance your experience with us. Enter your details to see the full story of our performance, and let's start a conversation about the future of AI-driven trading.</p>
